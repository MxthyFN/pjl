If you are experiencing trouble with our script, look at some options below.



Re-Executing ; Some times when you are using a script, the executor may want you to re-execute, if you re-execute but it doesn't work look at more options.

Executor/PC Shutdown ; If you use certain executors for a long amount of time, or keep your PC on during the night, it may cause lag on your executor or PC. Try fully exiting your executor and/or restarting your computer.

Contacting Support ; Contacting your executor support to see if they are currently patched may help your case. If it they can't help you, check the last option.
 
Contact Us; If none of the above working, contact us VIA PJL's discord (linked below) If nobody can help you, consider waiting till a executor/script update.
